Japan is located at the junction of several tectonic plates, making it rich in volcanic mountains and calderas. With over 100 volcanic mountains—more than almost any other country—Japan is famous for its onsen (hot springs) and dramatic volcanic landscapes. While most people know that mountains form due to volcanic activity, fewer realize that lakes can also be born from volcanoes. These are called caldera lakes. One such gem in Hokkaido is Lake Toya (Toya-ko).

Lake Toya is almost perfectly round, stretching 9 km north-south and 11 km east-west, covering about 70 square kilometers. It is the ninth largest lake in Japan and the third largest caldera lake. Toya-ko is a popular tourist destination, renowned for its castle cruise rides and the opportunity to walk around Nakajima Island, one of four islands at the lake's center. Nakajima itself is a volcanic island that formed later. The area also features Stone Age archaeological remains, nominated as a candidate for World Heritage status, bringing Lake Toya international attention.
