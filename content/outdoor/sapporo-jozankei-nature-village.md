Sapporo Jozankei Nature Village is a campsite about 45 minutes by car from Sapporo, nestled in the deep Jozankei forest near Houheikyou Onsen and dam. It’s a perfect spot for novice campers, offering a range of lodging options—cottages, tent houses, and open tent sites. You can also bring your own camping gear and equipment.

The tent site is spacious enough for 3–4 people and is a budget-friendly choice, especially popular with veteran campers and cyclists. Booking is required, and the site is very popular on weekends and holidays, so it’s best to reserve as early as possible (up to two months in advance). Booking is by phone (011-598-3100, 9:00–17:00, except weekends and holidays). The staff speak Japanese, but simple English works too. For English inquiries, you can use the [official website form](http://www.sj-naturevillage.jp/inquiry/).
