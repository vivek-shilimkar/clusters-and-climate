__Enjoying the wild onsen near Mt. Shikaribetsu__


Japan is world famous for its serene natural beauty, making it a paradise for bicycling, camping, and hiking. Camping in Japan’s forests is a unique experience—especially in Hokkaido, where the forests are home to bears. There are many places in Hokkaido where you can camp and enjoy a wild onsen for free.

One such spot is near Mt. Shikaribetsu in Shikaoi. This place is more famous for its wild onsen than for camping, probably because there’s a large campsite nearby. If you have the right gear and experience, I highly recommend camping near the onsen itself for a true wilderness adventure.

There are three different onsen tubs. Since these are wild, you may need to clean and prepare them before use—unless someone else has already done so. During our visit, we met an 85-year-old man who has maintained the tubs since he was 30. His dedication and stories were inspiring; he’s even bought expensive equipment with his own money to keep the onsen clean.

If you visit, please leave the place as you found it. If you make a fire, use a stove and always clean up before you leave.

**Location details:**
- There’s a gate on the road to the wild onsen that says “No Entry.” You may open the gate, enter, and close it again—this is the local custom. Visiting is not illegal or prohibited, but the sign is there for some reason.

Happy soaking and camping in Hokkaido’s wild beauty!
