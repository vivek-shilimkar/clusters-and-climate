Sapporo Dake trek in Sapporo, Japan, was my first night trek in a foreign country. My friend Tomo, an experienced mountaineer, joined me and knew the mountain well. Our goal: to witness a breathtaking sunrise and the sparkling city lights from the summit. At 1235 meters, with the base nearly at sea level, we planned a two-stage climb.

We started climbing in the afternoon. In Pune, climbing a mountain in the afternoon feels like turning on a heater in 40°C and getting drenched in sweat. But in Sapporo, in October, the daytime temperature was as low as 15°C, so we could climb comfortably. Tomo, a veteran adventurer, handed me a knife and bear spray before we started. That made me a bit nervous! He explained how to respond if we encountered a bear, and then we set off.

After a few hours, we reached the hut where we’d rest until late night. I was surprised by how well-equipped it was for cooking and survival.

There was a huge pile of wood below the hut, ready for winter. Tomo was the caretaker for the hut and climbers until the next afternoon. As we settled in, two Japanese girls arrived. One of them, though petite, was carrying a 60L backpack—about 20kg, half her weight! She quickly started gathering wood for a campfire. I joined her, but when I tried to use the wood from the pile, she politely stopped me: that wood was for heating the hut in winter, not for campfires. Her discipline, even when no one was watching, was impressive.

We lit a fire before dark, as it gets cold quickly on the mountain. We shared beers and vegan ramen for dinner—so delicious that my mouth waters just remembering it!

Tomo and I had planned to watch the sunrise, so after dinner we rested and started climbing again at 3:00 AM to reach the summit before dawn. The night was pitch dark—just after a new moon. The silence was so deep I could hear my own heartbeat. Every few minutes, I checked for animals or bears. At one point, I heard leaves rustling and froze, but it was just the wind. Tomo was unfazed, but I hurried up the trail, feeling like I was walking alongside death. Thankfully, we never saw a bear.

At the summit, I was stunned by the night view of Sapporo City. I got busy adjusting my camera and taking as many photos as possible before sunrise. After about 20 minutes, I realized I was only wearing jeans and a T-shirt. Tomo had already put on all his winter clothes and a poncho, and was still feeling cold. Until I saw him, I didn’t feel the chill, but as soon as I did, the cold hit me too! I always believed that cold is for those who feel it—if you ignore it, you won’t feel it. So, even with just one jacket, I managed to withstand the temperature and wind.

There was little flat space on the summit—unlike the broad, fort-topped mountains of Pune. Sapporo Dake’s summit is barely 1000 square feet, not ideal for camping unless you’re experienced. As I explored, the sun began its journey across the “Country of the Rising Sun.” The sunrise, with its rays and long row of clouds, reminded me of the beautiful scenes from Indian TV epics like Ramayan and Mahabharat. But this was real—and truly breathtaking.

This kind of view makes you realize what you miss every day. The sunrise made me reflect on three kinds of people: those lost in technology, those who appreciate nature but are still its slaves (like me), and those who truly live free, in harmony with nature—like Tomo.
